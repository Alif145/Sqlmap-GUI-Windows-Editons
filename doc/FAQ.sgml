<sect1>General information

<sect2>What is sqlmap?

<p>
sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of
back-end database servers.
It comes with a broad range of features lasting from database
fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the
underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via
out-of-band connections.
